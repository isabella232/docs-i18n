# Translations of Sencha documentation

This repository contains Markdown sources of ExtJS and Touch guides.

To be able to generate the guides, install the `guider` tool through
Rubygems:

    $ gem install guider

Then run the build script:

    $ cd docs-i18n/
    $ ./build

This will write the guides as simple HTML pages into `./out`
directory.
